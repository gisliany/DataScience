# Foundation of Data Science

## First Class
Data science introduction. Main subjects covered:
* History
* Big data
* Applications
* Challenges
* Tools
* Data Science Analysis <br/>
...

## Second Class

In this class we learnt about:
* Git/Github
* Jupyter notebooks
* Python programming.

The exercises and their solutions are written in the notebook files contained in `Lesson 2` folder.

## Third Class

The use of NumPy and Pandas for scientific computing.

The exercises and their solutions are written in the notebook files contained in `Lesson 3` folder.

## Fourth Class

In this class we learnt to work with missing data and to filter data from dataset. To this end, we used pandas functions like `isnull()`, `pivot_table()`, `dropna()`, `apply()`, and others.

The exercises and their solutions are written in the notebook files contained in `Lesson 4` folder.

## Fifth Class

We learnt the basics of data visualization, a discipline that focuses on the visual representation of data.
To this end, we used the matplotlib library and we plotted line charts, bar charts and scatter charts.

The exercises and their solutions are written in the notebook files contained in `Lesson 5` folder.

## Sixth Class

In this class we learnt how to visualize distributions using histograms and box plots.

The exercises and their solutions are written in the notebook files contained in `Lesson 6` folder.

## Seventh Class

In this class we focused on how to use data visualization to communicate insights and tell stories. We started with a standard matplotlib plot and improve its appearance to better communicate the patterns we want a viewer to understand. We learnt how to customize colors, line widths, layout, and annotations too.

The exercises and their solutions are written in the notebook files contained in `Lesson 7` folder.

## Eighth Class

We worked with the seaborn visualization library, which is built on top of matplotlib. Seaborn has good support for more complex plots, attractive default styles, and integrates well with the pandas library.

The exercises and their solutions are written in the notebook files contained in `Lesson 8` folder.
