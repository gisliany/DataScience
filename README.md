# Foundation of Data Science

## First Class
Data science introduction. Main subjects covered:
* History
* Big data
* Applications
* Challenges
* Tools
* Data Science Analysis <br/>
...

## Second Class

In this class we learnt about:
* Git/Github
* Jupyter notebooks
* Python programming.

The exercises and their solutions are written in the notebook files contained in `Lesson 2` folder.

## Third Class

The use of NumPy and Pandas for scientific computing.

The exercises and their solutions are written in the notebook files contained in `Lesson 3` folder.

## Fourth Class

In this class we learnt to work with missing data and to filter data from dataset. To this end, we used pandas functions like `isnull()`, `pivot_table()`, `dropna()`, `apply()`, and others.

The exercises and their solutions are written in the notebook files contained in `Lesson 4` folder.

## Fifth Class

We learnt the basics of data visualization, a discipline that focuses on the visual representation of data.
To this end, we used the matplotlib library and we plotted line charts, bar charts and scatter charts.

The exercises and their solutions are written in the notebook files contained in `Lesson 5` folder.

## Sixth Class

In this class we learnt how to visualize distributions using histograms and box plots.

The exercises and their solutions are written in the notebook files contained in `Lesson 6` folder.

## Seventh Class

In this class we focused on how to use data visualization to communicate insights and tell stories. We started with a standard matplotlib plot and improve its appearance to better communicate the patterns we want a viewer to understand. We learnt how to customize colors, line widths, layout, and annotations too.

The exercises and their solutions are written in the notebook files contained in `Lesson 7` folder.

## Eighth Class

We worked with the seaborn visualization library, which is built on top of matplotlib. Seaborn has good support for more complex plots, attractive default styles, and integrates well with the pandas library.

The exercises and their solutions are written in the notebook files contained in `Lesson 8` folder.

## Ninth Class

We explored the fundamentals of geographic coordinate systems and how to work with the basemap and folium libraries to plot geographic data points on maps.

The exercises and their solutions are written in the notebook files contained in `Lesson 9` folder.

## Tenth Class

In this class, we analyzed geographic data on brazilian municipalities. Two group projects were developed using Choropleth Maps:

* Choropleth maps to represent the population on brazilian municipalities of Northeast Region (https://github.com/adrianabenicio/ChoroplethMap);

* Choropleth maps for price estimates of Uber rides (https://github.com/gisliany/uber-price-estimates)


## Eleventh Class

We used the requests library heavily as we learnt about Web scraping. This library enables us to download a Web page. We also used the beautifulsoup library to extract the relevant parts of the Web page.

The exercises and their solutions are written in the notebook files contained in `Lesson 11` folder.
